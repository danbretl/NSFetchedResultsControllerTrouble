This is a heavily stripped down version of a basic photo sharing app that I am currently developing. Each Photo is attached to a Feeling and a User. The most basic general view (the one visible in this version) is the Gallery. Here, you can view all Feelings, and for each Feeling, the 10 most recent Photos. There are two Gallery modes - "Alphabetical" and "Recent". When in "Alphabetical" mode, the Feelings are sorted alphabetically by the Feeling word. When in "Recent" mode, the Feelings are sorted by "most recently added to", meaning the Feeling that has had a Photo added to it most recently is at the top of the list.

My trouble is that the table is not responding to updates properly, especially (perhaps exclusively, though I have not 100% verified that) in "Recent" mode. It seems that NSFetchedResultsController is not responding to data updates correctly. Rows are not reordered properly, and sometimes a row that just moved to the top will take up both the first and second rows. What is confusing is that while the NSFetchedResultsController data prints as it should (with the newly updated "most recently added to" dates for the Feelings), it did not send the right delegate callbacks. (Specifically, it often reports an "...Update" instead of a "...Move".)

I am not sure if I am fundamentally misunderstanding NSFetchedResultsController, or if there is a problem with its Fetch, or with my Data Model in general. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated. This bug is holding up an app which is otherwise generally ready for the App Store, so I'm very eager to get it fixed. I've used NSFetchedResultsController many times before and never had such trouble. Thank you in advance for any help you can give me! Feel free to fork and tinker.

The backend data is hosted and served up by Parse.com, though that shouldn't really effect anything. If you feel a peek into the Parse database is necessary, please let me know.
